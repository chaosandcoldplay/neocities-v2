          <strong2>FIRST EVER DIARY ENTRY ON HERE WOOOO</strong2> thats
          definitely something. i'd abandoned every diary-adjacent paraphernalia
          maybe 7 or 8 years earlier so this is also extremely refreshing and
          weirdly nostalgic for whatever reason? except the entire experience is
          profoundly improved upon by the sheer fact of it existing in a site
          slash object that i've crafted from the ground-up.

          i'm still in awe of this here nugget of the internet that i've molded
          to my preferences as someone who knew jackshit about html or css
          <strong>just a month earlier</strong>, on the 1st of july.
          incidentally, this was also the day i started my 2 week long summer
          course on gravitational wave astronomy @ ICTS except i've forever been
          a slacker at heart (i've always worked best when procrastinating on a
          different task) which meant full immersion into front-end development,
          or at least learning to make sense of html's head and body (pun
          intended)<br />
          i distinctly remember coming across a website that highly struck my
          fancy (not disclosing which :-P) and by then i'd had an underlying
          desire to "make a neocities" for the longest time after seeing it
          everywhere over my time on the internet, so i copied the entire site's
          code into a burner neocities account to try and make modifications to
          it, eventually building it up to a vision i was satisfied with. this
          was the <strong>best/gravest mistake</strong> of my life.<br />
          not going into too many details about my gruelling experience
          traversing the rocky terrains of html/css/a dash of javascript as a
          <strong2>total (bumbling) beginner</strong2> but i remember tinkering
          with the copied site code for maybe a week until i got frustrated over
          it not being in line with the aesthetic i'd envisioned, mainly because
          (<strong>keep this in mind if you're a beginner like me!</strong>)
          when you copy code from someplace else, unspooling the customization
          an element is put through takes 3x times more than what you'd take to
          just code it out on your own if you know what the fuck's happening.
          this was my no.1 takeaway from the 1-week familiarization stint.
          another thing that helped me quite a bit was stumbling across an
          unknown term or attribute in a code snippet of my liking and
          immediately looking it up on w3schools, reddit or several online
          forums which was spontaneous enough to keep me engaged while also
          adding an assortment of new weapons to my css arsenal, to the point my
          mind felt stuffy after prolonged ventures into diverse rabbitholes.
          but it is so so worth it, and so <strong>fulfilling!</strong> im glad
          i finally have an independent space on the internet i can customize to
          my heart's content. the month-long obsession has also forced a
          (initially unintentional) complete
          <strong>wipeout of my social media cravings</strong> although one of
          my closest friends called me up because she was concerned about my
          radio silence everywhere LOL (i asked her to sign my guestbook here
          but she's still a no-show..)<br />
          anyway, the only reason i'm able to code day and night with
          near-hourly updates to my site is because i'm currently a NEET (it's
          been a good 2 months out of college #iHaveaBachelorsDegreeNow) and
          awaiting college decisions for <strong>masters in berlin</strong>. if
          i do get in, it'd solve every, or most of, my problems at the moment
          because i need to get out of this country expeditiously, if i don't,
          well, i don't even want to actualize what'd happen by writing it out
          here! it's been <strong2>2 fucking months</strong2> and they still
          haven't given me as much as an alert like GUYSSSSS im desperate :-(
          their decisions timeline concludes on the 31st of august though, so
          the neverending hope persists, and the click-clacking continues. the
          all-pervading anxiety and doubt because of the situation i'm in right
          now has resulted in really violent existential episodes at night and
          i've been voluntarily amplifying this shit by reading similar books
          and watching movies of the same ilk LMFAO i need to be stopped.
          regardless, i keep wondering why (re:this website or any creative
          pursuit) i even put so much effort into anything i do or into
          beautifying my situational environments (<strong2
            >both online and offline</strong2
          >) so fervently, because what use lies in preserving something that
          ultimately amounts to nothing? i tell myself it's to keep myself
          occupied for the extent of my life but my mind can filter out bullshit
          pretty easily, even if the spouter of them is me and i fear i'll
          mentally collapse if i don't read a whole lot of positive absurdist
          philosophy to counter this wave of destructive nihility i've been
          objected to lately. or receive a decision from the university i've
          applied to in berlin but we can't always have what we want. for now
          though, while i work on my perpetually deteriorating attention span,
          i'm going to keep chipping away at my website! if you've made it this
          far,
          <strong>here's a biscuit for you</strong>

          here's to many many years more of whining on this website of my
          creation! so excited to see everything else my aggravating brain has
          in store for both me and all of you ^__^<br /><br />
          <strong>p.s tomorrow marks 1 month of this site's existence</strong>
          (confetti starts falling out of every conceivable nook of whatever
          conceptual space the reader of this entry is in)
