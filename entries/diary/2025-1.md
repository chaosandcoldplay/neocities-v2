          <strong2>unhappy new year</strong2> Lol..i'll cut the theatrics
          actually but i've never felt worse. its not even because
          i'm....physically or situationally having an objectively bad time.
          things could not be more stable, and that stagnancy is exactly what i
          despise. i feel stuck, repeating the same year since 2020 again and
          again like i'm in somebody's horrible idea of a time loop and it just
          feels like my youth is passing me by
          <strong>(i'm 21 and a half apples tall)</strong>. lately i've come to
          realize that physics has lost the charm it had, and i really don't
          know if i want to make a career out of it and spend the next 4 to 5
          years studying for a job that i don't even know i'll like in case it
          isn't what my childhoood dream was. academia is bleak. mathematics is
          bleak. life currently is bleak. i seriously wish i was pursuing a
          masters in psychology in thailand right now instead...and living with
          my parents is sapping every last bit of my sanity and i do not know
          what to do to break out of this vicious cycle of depression and lack
          of initiative without a steady source of income which, again, i can't
          be receiving due to being a full-time student at a shit from butt
          univeristy. i seriously wish i wasn't a sentient being at the moment,
          it's dreary as fuck. i can't even find joy in the things i like, or
          used to like, every single day is nothing but an experiment in wasting
          time within the confines of my worn out mind. and still i trudge on.
          despite my mental state i want to read more books and try my hand at
          newer things this year, at least in the moments i can steal away from
          my <strong2>partially self-inflicted purgatory</strong2>. on the
          brighter side of things, i might be getting a new computer by next
          month! and i'll at least be able to immerse myself into
          <strong>ts4</strong> once again hitch-free. and over the last few
          weeks, i've been watching season 1 of true detective, basically just
          laboring through the episodes one by one whenever i'm on break or @
          the bus stop while i wait. rust is my
          <strong2>spirit animal</strong2> and i wish i could have his entire
          dialogue sheet available on demand to quote at any given point of time
          because he's kind of like, my mirror image in the word's purest sense.
          remember when i talked about wanting to read some amount of positive
          absurdist philosophy to counter the persistent wave of destructive
          nihilism i was suffering from? although the pretentious left (or right
          idgaf) could reduce true detective's essence or rust's character to an
          edgy 9th grader's rant, it still decidedly put my mind at peace, more
          so than reading the myth of sisyphus (but that might probably be
          because i wasn't paying a whole lot of attention reading it the first
          time). i think it really doesn't matter what the grade or phrenic
          quality of any given media is, i could literally have the Grinch move
          my heart if it was meant to because all art is human and meant to
          strike a human chord, no matter what kind. lately, i've also been
          religiously playing every morning and afternoon with a set of puppies
          on my campus. they're beautiful, and so guileless, and definitely one
          of the greater highlights of my life at the moment. its moments like
          these that i've been consciously adding to the general spectrum of my
          lived experiences and if viewed in terms of miniscule events of
          unadulterated bliss, i think my
          <strong>stupid chungus life</strong> could be worth adoring!<br /><br />
          anyway before signing off, just wanted to put this image up here
          because i've been thinking about it for quite some time.
