          had a dream that sarah beeelzebubs from twitter was sending goth valentine cards to all her mutuals and sent me a dm asking to be mutuals on tumblr so i could send her my address in an anonymous ask? she apparently sent me a screenshot of her tumblr profile (it was hyunjin and power themed) but . took separate screenshots of the pfp and header and sent them one after the other Which was kinda weird but nice! i followed her on tumblr but woke up immediately because i had a splitting headache lol (fun fact, i told her about this and we actually recreated the entire thing with the tumblr asks + her sending me a silly little gothic valentines card on feb 14th! so fun, i love people and peopling)

          watched it in 2 parts (probs stirred in my sleep) first part was set in an amalgamation of all my schools resembling liminal spaces, i was made to sit with the rest of our grade (all the sections?) in a theatre in the school...and heavy drafts of icy wind came in, sometimes it even brought tiny icicle particles which fell on us and it was my first time touching snow. after a while we were all forcefully ushered out and the area was blocked and by chance i'd left my backpack behind. a teacher of mine (who i recognized from college Now) tried dissuading me from going in but i skidded on the banisters coming-of-age film style and went in and grabbed my now wet bag. weird atmospheric dream and i could feel the palpable frigidness even in my sleep

second part was related to the wedding i'd be attending next week, the area was a somewhat traditional looking tirupati ripoff place with concrete platforms? and golden building toppers and what not, the house i was going to was in one of those cramped tirupati areas except it was like a kolkata colony instead, and i was made to go in and found out its an exact replica of one of my aunt‚Äôs houses in Goyeshpur. anyway it seems i was initially supposed to marry the groom (üò≠) but didn‚Äôt and also the climax of the story was apparently Zeus (yes the fucking greek god of thunder!) residing in one of the golden domes in the area, being pissed off about the wedding match. he brought several lethal thunderstorms and people setting the venue up had to start looking for new timings, preferably an hour or 2 hours later just so the bride wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúlognobhroshta‚Äù but apparently there was no better timing after this hour. weird as hell omg


there was also a subplot featuring a bunch of my old male crushes (crush?) but i don‚Äôt particularly remember much of that

          had a dream that mari (lila) from twitter was in close circles with lucy dacus and taylor swift (through ig shared posts, witty quips abd back and forths in the comment sections of posts etc) it was a fully instagram-centred dream, kind of like a social media au. very weird concoction of people though, idk why i keep dreaming about twitter mutuals

          i dont have a lot of memorable dreams lately (probably a combination of going to sleep late + extremely deep, drool inducing slumbers) but i had one this morning (i say morning because this was at 8 or 9 am and i woke up at 11)...it basically featured me going on vacation or for contractual work at some kind of mountainous, hilly region (very reminiscent of darjeeling!) and me looking pretty ravishing !?!@! i was also lowkey the life of the parties wherever i was at in terms of social presence, i made a ton of friends who, before i left im not sure for how much time, made sure to take my number and ig handle. the dream was full of little moments of fun and laughter between said people and my beautiful self being super charming (kind of unbelievable yea but whatever) and my god the GIRLS FEATURED WERE SO GORGEOUS :_) this could or couldnt of been foreshadowing for a better life 2026 onwards or it could be my soul mimicking my online persona and delusional-posting (although icl im very much lively in person despite the shit circumstances im in or the areas i frequent at the moment) but i earnestly hope its the former. amen to a life so full i feel overwhelmed on saturday nights as i sit and ponder in the company of a lonely lamp's shade
