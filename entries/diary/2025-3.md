          barely got anything to update in terms of diary entries these days because everyday's just a constant cycle of me desparately scooping my brain goo up and trying my hardest to make a properly functioning academic tool out of it (or as best of a rendition as humanly possible without any semblance of medication within my access!) and Fucking failing. im going to give it my all to get over my disability in the next 3 months though because i absolutely cannot afford to fuck this one last opportunity up...<strong2>laughs nervously</strong2>....loving the sky really is turning out to be the one greatest downfall of my stupid baka life with the amount of mental turmoil its been putting me through since 2019 :(<br /><br />  
anyhow moving onto the specifics of my current circumstances. the reason i had been so awol for the past 2 or so months is because of me finally delving into the world of <strong>sims 4 cc</strong> and content creation in hopes of one day making a wee profit off of something i love, for once. im doing quite well on most of the platforms ive been frequenting in pursuit of exposure, except twitter where...Well. i went viral, blew up, made friends and foes, got cancelled and finally got driven off the app all in the span of a month. it gets tiring to be very honest when the only <strong>problematic things</strong> youve ever done offline include losing your dad's japanese harmonica completely accidentally and lying about it, and the only <strong>problematic things</strong> youve done online include asking several people about followbacks when they broke the mutual (Girl 2022 me was especially cringeworthy) + sending people requests twice or on several platforms Per the links in their infopages or something ðŸ˜­ like i will never understand why anybody would ever harbor ill intent or friction towards me when i personally think and know for a fact i have the strongest moral sense among the people i have in my circles (when you the Realest bitch you know etc) and at the cost of sounding obnoxious as fuck im usually always politically right (please dont take this to mean im a blockhead thats completely closed off to any feedback; i love being corrected and i love debates more than anything) ALSO! i <strong2>freaking love people</strong2>...and i exercise radical empathy, been exercising it ever since i had the ability to critically think for myself which forms the foundation of a lot of my political or moral beliefs + thoughts. the point is, despite all of the aforementioned points i've had my fair share of people that've ended up disliking me for reasons i couldn't even begin to comprehend and you know what hell yeah! i dont fw a lot of people for completely unexplained reasons as well but when the hatred stems from falsities and misassumptions...i dont think the people pleaser in me has completely died after all given i care this much about every single person i've crossed paths with. then again ive been trying to drum the fact into my being that Not everybody i meet throughout my lifetime will end up liking me and trying to undo any potential dislike exhibited by anybody is a futile and sisyphean task that shouldn't be bothered with. will that stop me? <strong2>only time can tell</strong2>, but i've not particularly succeeded as of yet :P<br /><br />
coming back to my ts4 chronicles. It was genuinely unnerving seeing how easily people can turn on you over brainwash-esque allegations, and how the webscape really is super mercurial at the end of the day..but then again thats the real world as well isn't it? plus twitter in itself is a special kind of shithole and i'm not sure if i'll ever go back there for displaying my ts4 content ngl..i might at some point but the chances are slim. communities like this are also unwelcoming and closed off in how they function and i've always felt disturbed in spaces that are overly cliquey as somebody that thrives on peopling wherever i go. this is lowkey a qualm i've nursed for pretty much every part of the internet, even neocities! and this ties back to my previous point about people not vibing with me for whatever reason. which is...i mean it makes sense especially when seen from a <strong2>sociological perspective</strong2> with how groups founded on common interest slowly form in different internet niches, their dynamics taking shape gradually and these dynamics cementing to the point the groups in question are eventually aversed to any "alien" contact. honestly doesn't matter how hard i try, i won't ever be able to fit into every single community i take a liking to because there comes a point when i'd no longer like to compromise with what i create or present myself as simply for the sake of socialization! and this means giving up on connections that were never meant to be in the first place. i need to stop being a <strong>disgusting extrovert</strong> omfgggg (i need a more fulfilling irl life for that tbh)<br /><br />
coming back to (god i have SUCH a bad habit of going off on tangents) the actual work i've been doing with respect to ts4 content creation. IM FINALLY LEARNING BLENDER AND ZBRUSH IM SO HAPPY! the unexpected and Multiple facets of creativity that came with sims 4 content creation....like wow the creative in me has never been more sated! i've been <strong>3D modelling and graphic designing</strong> like there's no tomorrow and i'm only getting better. i think i'm about to learn AE + premiere as well because of it JWKJEWKJQ but never again am i showing my storytelling content to twitter fuck yew all...this + my art account + my neocities website will forever keep my upskilling going despite never learning art from anybody or anywhere and i'm somewhat happy to be exposed to the best of both worlds as far as both art + STEM go :) i do of course want to, eventually, start making my graphics for everything from scratch like so many talented webmasters or graphic designers i've had the honor of meeting over my 5 year long stay on the internet. i want to cultivate my own aesthetically driven body of work and also like...despite loving my current designing and work everywhere i do still want to start <strong2>Actually Creating</strong2> things as opposed to reusing stuff thats public domain ya feel me? I need to get over my photoshop and csp intimidation stat...is youtube even helpful in recent times...lets find out (after my exams for this month finish of course)<br /><br />
outside of my sims 4 caper(s) there isn't much happening in my life and whatever Is happening isn't worth elucidating here. i've shifted houses btw and theres this 7 month old baby that i have to myself for over an hour every day because her parents (+ the baby herself) have taken a really strong liking to me :-) I LOVE PINCHING HER CHEEKS SO BAD shes literally the cutest thing ever..her name is <strong>lailu</strong> and if possible i'd love to post her on my Album page here one day on receiving permission from her parents/finishing the page!!! i've been saying this over and over in diary entries here but amidst how horrible life is, little things like these really do shine through and make life worth living, one day at a time. its not the best, but <strong>its something</strong> :-)<br /><br /><img
