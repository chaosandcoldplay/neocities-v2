          short dream because i woke up in an hour or so but it started with
          some kind of..muscular, old guy (looked like sylvester stallone? or
          perhaps an amalgamation of several similarly aged old men i've come
          across in my 21 years of living) spanning the walls of a gym-ish room
          on all fours like spiderman. on entering the room, i happened to be
          extremely impressed at this feat and went so far as to ask him how he
          was doing this. he showed me a back/shoulder clench exercise to be
          done several times in a row for one set, 10 to 15 times (or perferably
          more) in order to up my back flexibility. pretty sure doing that alone
          doesn't give you spidey powers but i caught myself trying it out while
          showering anyway

          extremely embarrassing thing to type out but today's dream was purely
          brainrot-centered. don't recall most of it but it involved hitting a
          skibidi toilet rendition in a cubicle that somehow spawned in the
          center of a busy street several times with lava-like laser beams,
          which is hard to believe given i had no weapons of any kind in the
          dream. i'm not even sure how it ended but i'm glad it did
