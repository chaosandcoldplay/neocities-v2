                    <strong2>FIRST EVER DIARY ENTRY ON HERE WOOOO</strong2> thats definitely something. i'd abandoned
                    every diary-adjacent paraphernalia maybe 7 or 8 years earlier so this is also extremely refreshing
                    and weirdly nostalgic for whatever reason? except the entire experience is profoundly improved upon
                    by the sheer fact of it existing in a site slash object that i've crafted from the ground-up.
                    <img src="https://file.garden/ZAkEYVkUN2HXHCu3/web/graphics/imademywebsite.gif" /> i'm still in awe
                    of this here nugget of the internet that i've molded to my preferences as someone who knew jackshit
                    about html or css <strong>just a month earlier</strong>, on the 1st of july. incidentally, this was
                    also the day i started my 2 week long summer course on gravitational wave astronomy @ ICTS except
                    i've forever been a slacker at heart (i've always worked best when procrastinating on a different
                    task) which meant full immersion into front-end development, or at least learning to make sense of
                    html's head and body (pun intended)<br />
                    i distinctly remember coming across a website that highly struck my fancy (not disclosing which :-P)
                    and by then i'd had an underlying desire to "make a neocities" for the longest time after seeing it
                    everywhere over my time on the internet, so i copied the entire site's code into a burner neocities
                    account to try and make modifications to it, eventually building it up to a vision i was satisfied
                    with. this was the <strong>best/gravest mistake</strong> of my life.<br />
                    not going into too many details about my gruelling experience traversing the rocky terrains of
                    html/css/a dash of javascript as a <strong2>total (bumbling) beginner</strong2> but i remember
                    tinkering with the copied site code for maybe a week until i got frustrated over it not being in
                    line with the aesthetic i'd envisioned, mainly because (<strong
                        >keep this in mind if you're a beginner like me!</strong
                    >) when you copy code from someplace else, unspooling the customization an element is put through
                    takes 3x times more than what you'd take to just code it out on your own if you know what the fuck's
                    happening. this was my no.1 takeaway from the 1-week familiarization stint. another thing that
                    helped me quite a bit was stumbling across an unknown term or attribute in a code snippet of my
                    liking and immediately looking it up on w3schools, reddit or several online forums which was
                    spontaneous enough to keep me engaged while also adding an assortment of new weapons to my css
                    arsenal, to the point my mind felt stuffy after prolonged ventures into diverse rabbitholes. but it
                    is so so worth it, and so <strong>fulfilling!</strong> im glad i finally have an independent space
                    on the internet i can customize to my heart's content. the month-long obsession has also forced a
                    (initially unintentional) complete <strong>wipeout of my social media cravings</strong> although one
                    of my closest friends called me up because she was concerned about my radio silence everywhere LOL
                    (i asked her to sign my guestbook here but she's still a no-show..)<br />
                    anyway, the only reason i'm able to code day and night with near-hourly updates to my site is
                    because i'm currently a NEET (it's been a good 2 months out of college #iHaveaBachelorsDegreeNow)
                    and awaiting college decisions for <strong>masters in berlin</strong>. if i do get in, it'd solve
                    every, or most of, my problems at the moment because i need to get out of this country
                    expeditiously, if i don't, well, i don't even want to actualize what'd happen by writing it out
                    here! it's been <strong2>2 fucking months</strong2> and they still haven't given me as much as an
                    alert like GUYSSSSS im desperate :-( their decisions timeline concludes on the 31st of august
                    though, so the neverending hope persists, and the click-clacking continues. the all-pervading
                    anxiety and doubt because of the situation i'm in right now has resulted in really violent
                    existential episodes at night and i've been voluntarily amplifying this shit by reading similar
                    books and watching movies of the same ilk LMFAO i need to be stopped. regardless, i keep wondering
                    why (re:this website or any creative pursuit) i even put so much effort into anything i do or into
                    beautifying my situational environments (<strong2>both online and offline</strong2>) so fervently,
                    because what use lies in preserving something that ultimately amounts to nothing? i tell myself it's
                    to keep myself occupied for the extent of my life but my mind can filter out bullshit pretty easily,
                    even if the spouter of them is me and i fear i'll mentally collapse if i don't read a whole lot of
                    positive absurdist philosophy to counter this wave of destructive nihility i've been objected to
                    lately. or receive a decision from the university i've applied to in berlin but we can't always have
                    what we want. for now though, while i work on my perpetually deteriorating attention span, i'm going
                    to keep chipping away at my website! if you've made it this far,
                    <strong>here's a biscuit for you</strong>
                    <img src="https://wilardo.crd.co/assets/images/gallery02/032264f6_original.gif" /> here's to many
                    many years more of whining on this website of my creation! so excited to see everything else my
                    aggravating brain has in store for both me and all of you ^__^<br /><br />
                    <strong>p.s tomorrow marks 1 month of this site's existence</strong> (confetti starts falling out of
                    every conceivable nook of whatever conceptual space the reader of this entry is in)

                    <strong2>evening!</strong2> couldn't muster more of an enthusiastic energy because i just got
                    rejected (excluded? it wasn't a rejection since my bachelors degree wasn't apparently enough for
                    their rigorous coursework and they considered me unfit right off the bat for their masters program)
                    from the college i was aiming at, but for whatever reason it hasn't affected me as much as i thought
                    it would. this could just be my <strong>complacence</strong> in the face of misfortune that has
                    built over the years but regardless, i feel... okay. the world didn't end when i fucked up my school
                    leaving examinations 3 years earlier, the world didn't end when my inbox pinged 2 nights back,
                    bearing news potent enough to shatter several plans and fantasies of a better future i had woven to
                    keep myself alive over the past year or two. the world is <strong>rigged</strong> as it is,
                    nothing's real! am i even here? is everything just a figment of somebody's extremely grotesque
                    daydream? the beauty lies in the void of not knowing i suppose. <br />
                    depressing drivel aside, i've actually come across an opportunity of a masters program that'd
                    surpass the benefits of the german plan i'd made even, if it does in fact happen. i've discovered
                    <strong2>chile</strong2> and its
                    <strong2>extremely astronomy-driven public universities</strong2>!!! if things go right i'd not only
                    be doing a course completely focused on observational astronomy but it'll help me work on a possible
                    PHd thesis beforehand due to a faculty solely dedicated to astronomy! eventually my job prospects
                    should also unfold in chile itself due to the extent of observatories in there. genuinely so hyped @
                    imagining my life there because i would've had to move to Santiago or to the US for a plethora of
                    job openings in my desired field as it stands, and settling there so much earlier would ease things
                    up a lot..also i'd finally get to <strong2>learn spanish</strong2>. and
                    <strong2>rizz up latinas</strong2>. exciting. the results should be out by mid-Nov so i've got 2
                    more months of agonizing waiting Yet Again, although i'm planning on upping the skincare and
                    exercise regimens coupled with spanish lessons and an absolute brush-up of my cosmology and quantum
                    mechanics foundations since i'm already beginning to forget :P maybe get my red belt in taekwondo in
                    the meanwhile as well, i've been stuck at blue for far too long. one thing's for sure though, no
                    more moping around waiting for something to magically click,
                    <strong>change starts whenever i want it to</strong>.<br /><br />

                    >
                    i think i'm going to better my backend dev skills so i can formulate a web form interface of some
                    kind that i can upload a diary entry to like a normal, say, blogging website, and have the
                    javascript sort itself out automatically. this is kind of clunky but hey i'm just starting out ^__^

                    9.7.24<br /><br />
                    short dream because i woke up in an hour or so but it started with some kind of..muscular, old guy
                    (looked like sylvester stallone? or perhaps an amalgamation of several similarly aged old men i've
                    come across in my 21 years of living) spanning the walls of a gym-ish room on all fours like
                    spiderman. on entering the room, i happened to be extremely impressed at this feat and went so far
                    as to ask him how he was doing this. he showed me a back/shoulder clench exercise to be done several
                    times in a row for one set, 10 to 15 times (or perferably more) in order to up my back flexibility.
                    pretty sure doing that alone doesn't give you spidey powers but i caught myself trying it out while
                    showering anyway
                    <br /><br /><br />

                    9.8.24<br /><br />
                    extremely embarrassing thing to type out but today's dream was purely brainrot-centered. don't
                    recall most of it but it involved hitting a skibidi toilet rendition in a cubicle that somehow
                    spawned in the center of a busy street several times with lava-like laser beams, which is hard to
                    believe given i had no weapons of any kind in the dream. i'm not even sure how it ended but i'm glad
                    it did

                    <strong2>unhappy new year</strong2> Lol..i'll cut the theatrics actually but i've never felt worse.
                    its not even because i'm....physically or situationally having an objectively bad time. things could
                    not be more stable, and that stagnancy is exactly what i despise. i feel stuck, repeating the same
                    year since 2020 again and again like i'm in somebody's horrible idea of a time loop and it just
                    feels like my youth is passing me by <strong>(i'm 21 and a half apples tall)</strong>. lately i've
                    come to realize that physics has lost the charm it had, and i really don't know if i want to make a
                    career out of it and spend the next 4 to 5 years studying for a job that i don't even know i'll like
                    in case it isn't what my childhoood dream was. academia is bleak. mathematics is bleak. life
                    currently is bleak. i seriously wish i was pursuing a masters in psychology in thailand right now
                    instead...and living with my parents is sapping every last bit of my sanity and i do not know what
                    to do to break out of this vicious cycle of depression and lack of initiative without a steady
                    source of income which, again, i can't be receiving due to being a full-time student at a shit from
                    butt univeristy. i seriously wish i wasn't a sentient being at the moment, it's dreary as fuck. i
                    can't even find joy in the things i like, or used to like, every single day is nothing but an
                    experiment in wasting time within the confines of my worn out mind. and still i trudge on. despite
                    my mental state i want to read more books and try my hand at newer things this year, at least in the
                    moments i can steal away from my <strong2>partially self-inflicted purgatory</strong2>. on the
                    brighter side of things, i might be getting a new computer by next month! and i'll at least be able
                    to immerse myself into <strong>ts4</strong> once again hitch-free. and over the last few weeks, i've
                    been watching season 1 of true detective, basically just laboring through the episodes one by one
                    whenever i'm on break or @ the bus stop while i wait. rust is my
                    <strong2>spirit animal</strong2> and i wish i could have his entire dialogue sheet available on
                    demand to quote at any given point of time because he's kind of like, my mirror image in the word's
                    purest sense. remember when i talked about wanting to read some amount of positive absurdist
                    philosophy to counter the persistent wave of destructive nihilism i was suffering from? although the
                    pretentious left (or right idgaf) could reduce true detective's essence or rust's character to an
                    edgy 9th grader's rant, it still decidedly put my mind at peace, more so than reading the myth of
                    sisyphus (but that might probably be because i wasn't paying a whole lot of attention reading it the
                    first time). i think it really doesn't matter what the grade or phrenic quality of any given media
                    is, i could literally have the Grinch move my heart if it was meant to because all art is human and
                    meant to strike a human chord, no matter what kind. lately, i've also been religiously playing every
                    morning and afternoon with a set of puppies on my campus. they're beautiful, and so guileless, and
                    definitely one of the greater highlights of my life at the moment. its moments like these that i've
                    been consciously adding to the general spectrum of my lived experiences and if viewed in terms of
                    miniscule events of unadulterated bliss, i think my <strong>stupid chungus life</strong> could be
                    worth adoring!<br /><br />
                    anyway before signing off, just wanted to put this image up here because i've been thinking about it
                    for quite some time. <br /><br /><img
